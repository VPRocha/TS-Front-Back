# TYPESCRIPT FRONTEND-BACKEND PROJECT

This is a simple project demonstrating communication between a front-end and a back-end using TypeScript.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

### `backend/`
This folder contains the code for the back-end server.

### `frontend/`
Here is the code for the front-end client.

## PREREQUISITES
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or Yarn

## HOW TO RUN

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend/` folder.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to start the backend server.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run server` or `yarn run server` to start the front-end client.

## HOW IT WORKS

The front-end is accessed via `http://localhost:8080` and communicates with the back-end running on `http://localhost:3000`.

The code is written in TypeScript for both parts, allowing for a more robust development experience with static typing.
